# Maximum-number-of-edges-in-a-connected-graph-with-n-vertices-and-diameter-d

A graph is said to be **connected** if every pair of vertices in the graph is connected. This means that there is a path between every pair of vertices.  
The diameter **d** of a graph is the maximum eccentricity of any vertex in the graph. That is, **d** is the greatest distance between any pair of vertices or  
<div align="center">$d = \max_{v \in V} \epsilon(v) = \max_{v \in V} \max_{u \in V} d(v,u)$.</div>
